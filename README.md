- I am currently a postdoctoral scientist working within Chris Quinceâ€™s group at Earlham Institute, where my focus is on the development of scalable methods and software for assembling HiFi metagenomics data.
- My interests lie in the development of **scalable tools** for interpreting **metagenomics** data. These tools exploit lightweight methods, such as **minimizers** and **minhash sketches**, as well as high-resolution data structures, such as **assembly graphs**.
- I work on both **short-read** data, having developed [Simka](https://github.com/GATB/simka) for quickly comparing hundreds of metagenomics samples,  and **long-read** technology, having developed [metaMDBG](https://github.com/GaetanBenoitDev/metaMDBG) for rapidly recovering complete circularized microbial genomes from metagenomes.
